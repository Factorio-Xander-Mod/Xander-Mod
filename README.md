# Xander-Mod

This mod completely overhauls several large chunks of the base game, in particular the production of raw materials, 
bulk resources, intermediate parts, and machines themselves. It also adds a variety of new & upgraded machines for 
production & logistics to help with this. A few additional combat supplies have been added for good measure, and to 
provide more use for advanced materials & parts.

======
Gameplay -

The early game has been extended for greater realism and sense of accomplishment.  Reaching the standard electric machines in the base game is now a noticeable achievement.  The goal is to create a greater contrast between the crude start and standard automation, to heighten the sense of accomplishment from progressing through the entire technology tree.

Most early machines and supplies have been balanced to a similar raw resource cost as in vanilla, but the expanded detail in everything boosts the difficulty.  Later in the game, I plan to increase the expense of things somewhat, to create a marathon-like experience throughout.
